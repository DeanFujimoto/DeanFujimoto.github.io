For my EE 396 project, I was tasked with designed with creating a robot that can be accessed by anyone online. The reason we had to shut it down was actually because it worked too well and it became a security issue, since it could be accessed by anyone online. We named it Ellie Bot.

The robot was initially thought up by a UH investor who wanted to check on his lab and tasked us with creating a robot so he can see what we were up to. After that, we decided to make a robot that can be remotely accessed that anyone can use from their web-browser. 

I was tasked with creating the website and sending the signals to the robots, my teammates were tasked with receiving the messages and making the robot move accordingly. To do this, we used a raspberry pi attached to a base roomba attached using a 3-D printed mount. We then used blue mix to interpret the data received from the website and turn it into information that the roomba could interpret. The robot also had a camera that we connected and streamed to youtube. Unfortunately, we had to take down the website due to security issues since anyone could remotely access the robot.
