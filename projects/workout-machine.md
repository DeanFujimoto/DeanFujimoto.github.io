summary: Responsible for designing a novel workout machine from Johnson Health Tech.
---


As a Freshman at the University of Wisconsin, my group was tasked with designing a functional prototype for Johnson Health Tech. Our group was tasked with designing a machine that Johnson Health Tech had never seen before. We were required to create a prototype as well as file for a patent for this new design.

This was an extremely unique experience because we were on very tight deadlines and budgetary restraints given to us by the clients. My group ended creating a push-up machine using extremely pressurized tubes to create resistance. 

In this project, I gained experience working with clients, working in large groups, designing schematics and testing equipment so it meets standards. My group also gained experience in the patent process. 

The biggest challenge for me was working with such a large group. There were about 12 of us. We all had to agree on one idea and we all had to agree on how to implement that idea. This was extremely tough with no team captain or external guidence. We all had to learn to come together to contribute ideas in a constructive way.
