I have always considered coding standards as more of a coding etiquette. I don’t think it should be required, but you probably should comply to make everyone else’s life more pleasant. For example, Steve Jobs wouldn’t shower, that’s poor etiquette, however he did very good work so it was alright. If you do very good work and you feel the standards are weighing you down, maybe it’s ok. However, for the rest of us, you probably should follow some standards to help people out.

This of course does not apply if you are working alone or do not want other people copying your code. No one cares if you put your elbows on the table when you are home alone.

One example of a program being improved from coding standards is Linux. Linux uses POSIX standards, which lent to its ability to be modified by anyone using open source. If everyone is able to easily read what each other are writing it creates a common language which can be improved upon.

As for my time with programming using ESLint, I don’t like it. I did not like the UH unix standards for C either. At times the UH unix standards made the programs less functional and harder to read. ESLint can be extremely annoying when pointing out things that will slow me down such as not letting me compile when there are unused variables. When testing to see if a program’s logic is correct, it can be extremely annoying. 

One great benefit of being in the engineering department rather than computer science is that in engineering classes we are generally not required to follow coding standards. For most of the electrical engineering classes, we are allowed to import libraries whenever we want and we do not have to use documentation or follow coding standards. The same program will take significantly less time to write and test in EE classes since we do not need to format our programs.
