Contrary to popular belief, property managers LOVE filling their rentals with college students. College students always answer their phones, they’re normally manageable, and many of them have guarantors just in case they cannot pay rent. I know this because I manage 200+ units and I’m constantly looking to fill them with students. 

However, I can never find college students and college students can never find me. This is probably because most of them have never tried looking for housing before and universities make it seem like dorm life is the easiest and only solution. Dorm life is not only cramped and overpriced, but it is bad practice for living independently. UH offers extremely small studios (which they call one-bedrooms) with a roommate and communal bathroom for $6,566.00. You can look at https://manoa.hawaii.edu/housing/communities for all the pricing. Needless to say, it is much higher than fair market value. In some cases, for example the Gateway house’s 2 bed 1 bath with four occupants which goes for $6,566.00, it exceeds double the market value for the area.


Bad landlords and bad properties definitely exist. There are apps for rating everything except for rating longer term rental properties, which if you’re signing a lease for almost a year, you would probably want to know beforehand. 

The app I am proposing will be similar to ratemyprofessor and yelp, only 10x better, because it will be for housing college students. If landlords want college students, they can post their unit on the app. From there, a licensed brokerage that subscribes to the ethics of the Honolulu Board of Realtors can take over the property management of it with the students. This app will also provide opportunities to find roommates.

Layout: The app will have three different functionalities
1. If you are a landlord, you can post a property and students will be able to review your property after they have stayed there. You can also see the students that want to apply. If you receive bad ratings you can simply withdraw and continue renting to non-college students. You can also see which managers are looking for contracts. Landlords will not be able to see students if they have not applied yet.

2. If you are a student, you can find properties and other students to be roommates with. The properties tab will have cards for the different properties, their ratings, their prices and if you click on them, it will show if other students are looking for roommates. The finding roommates tab will show cards of different students that you could potentially see yourself living with.

3. If you are a property manager, you can see which students are looking and which landlords need management, you can match them and manage their agreement. This is crucial because the property managers not only make sure each party is acting ethically, but it is generally not great if the landlord and tenant communicate directly. They need some sort of buffer.
